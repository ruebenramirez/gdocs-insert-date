I journal every day into the same google doc and I start each entry by typing the date and weekday each morning.  Because I do this so frequently, I decided to look for a solution to automate inserting this text into my journal entry.

I found this [example][1] app script that got me most of the way there.  The only thing missing was the format of the date that I use.

Example of the date format I use: 2021-04-07 Wednesday

additional date format settings are documented [here][2]

The app script code in this repo is largely borrowed from the stackexchange answer and modified slightly to output my preferred date format.
